                <h2>1. Vegetables Can Make You Tan</h2>
              <p>Eating veggies has plenty of health benefits, but it also has cosmetic ones, according to researchers at Leeds University and the University at St. Andrews.

This is due to a process called “carotenoid colorization.” To find out more crazy celebrity facts like this one, check out these 50 Crazy Celebrity Facts You Won’t Believe Are True.</p>

                <p>Your favorite yellow fruit may have a, let’s say, suggestive shape.

                <h2>15. Spicy Food Can Cut Down on Fat Intake</h2>
              <p>Consuming spices has been found to help cut down on how much fat you take in. A study by researchers at Pennsylvania State University concluded that adding significant amounts of turmeric, black pepper, or cinnamon to a fatty meal impedes the amount of triglyceride (the bad fat that increases risk of heart disease) taken into the blood by as much as 30 percent.</p>
